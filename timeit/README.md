# Timeit

It's a very simple countdown timer extension made using HTML, CSS, JS.

It simply has two buttons:
- Start
    : Starts the timer
- Reset
    : Resets the timer

The timer is set to 25 minutes by default, and there is no way to edit it without changing the code. I made it this way because I wanted to keep it simple.

I built this extension because one day one of my college juniors was struggling with adding a timer to her extention. I thought it would be a good idea to make a simple timer extension that she could use as a reference. But most importantly I want to challenege myself and see if I can make this within 3 minutes. Results? I succeeded.

Practically its useless.
